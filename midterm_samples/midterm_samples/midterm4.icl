/* Instructions
You are given 13 exercises each of 10 points. Min 5 perfect solutions (50 points) is required for passed, max is 100 points, you can choose which ones to solve.

Find on local C: drive the Clean compiler.

Copy the text into a  .icl file, save into your documents folder where you can compile.

Only this browser and compiler should be active during programming.

KEEP this browser open until you submit. MULTIPLE  task  taking IS NOT POSSIBLE.

After you finish coding UPLOAD here the file, JUST .icl file, and PRESS SUBMIT.

After SUBMIT the FILE CAN NOT BE CHANGED, MULTIPLE UPLOADS, MULTIPLE SUBMITS IS NOT POSSIBLE.

 

Your submission should not have any errors when running the code.

It is possible to get partial points for not fully working code, but please make sure you comment out the errors.

You should not delete anything from the given code, given test cases should stay the same, but you can add your tests as well.

Don't change the given function signatures, however, you can add as many functions as you wish, just make sure to name them appropriately.

Make sure that you comment all 'Start'-s before submitting the code.

-- I have not copied or used third-party solutions.

-- I have not passed my solution to my classmates, neither made it public.

-- Students' regulation of Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C.)

-- it will count as a disciplinary fault.

-- The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal

//// Disarium number
/*1.
Given a positive integer number, check if the given number
is a Disarium number or not.
A Disarium number is a number defined by the following:
Sum of its digits powered with their respective position
is equal to the original number.
Example: 135 is a Disarium number, 1^1+3^2+5^3 = 135.

//// Harshad numbers
/*2.
Given a list of positive integer numbers, return a list that
contains the Harshad numbers of the list.
A Harshad number is an integer that is divisible by the sum of
its digits when written in that base.
Examples:
200 True, the sum of digits is 2+0+0=2 and 200 is divisible by 2.
171 True, the sum of digits is 1+7+1=9 and 171 is divisible by 9.

//// Leader numbers of a list
/*3.
Given a list of integer numbers, return all the leaders in the list.
A number is leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements
to its right side in a list.
Example: [10,9,14,23,15,0,9] -> [23,15,9]
23 is greater than all the numbers to its right 15,0,9.
15 is greater than all the numbers to its right 0,9.

//// Replacing
/*4.
Given the list and a number K, remove all numbers that are divisible by K
and replace all other with reminder by K. Return resulting list.
Example: [1,3,8,6,2], K=3 -> [1,2,2]
3 and 6 are removed as they are divisible by 3.

Given a list of tuples, each with 3 numbers.
For each tuple check if these 3 numbers
can be used as sides of a triangle,

3 numbers can be sides of triangles if each pair's
sum is greater than the remaining 3rd number.
A number cannot be a side if it is negative or 0.

//// Failed-passed students

Given list of tuples and an integer value representing the 'pass_marks',
each tuple represents a student (name,marks), write a function which
groups the students into two categories based on their marks obtained in a test.
The function should return a tuple containing the list of the students
who failed, and the list of the students who passed.

List: [("Ramesh",23), ("Vivek",40), ("Harsh",88), ("Mohammad",60)], pass_marks: 30
Output: ([("Ramesh",23)],[("Vivek",40), ("Harsh",88), ("Mohammad",60)])

//// Ciphering
/*10.
Given a list of characters, extract all the vowels and count them.
After that, cipher the list of characters by that count.
Ciphering here means just shift the character by that count.
English vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u.
Example: let's assume that the vowels' count is 2, then:
'a' + 2 = 'c' ... Here we ciphered 'a' into 'c'
'c' + 2 = 'e' ... We did the same as above
For the input ['m', 'o', 'h', 'i','d','o'] count of vowels is 3 o,i,o.
Cipher of the list: ['m', 'o', 'h', 'i','d','o']->['p','r','k','l','g','r'].

Given coordinates of a source point (x1, y1) determine if it is possible to reach

From any point (x, y) there are only two types of valid movements: (x, x + y)
and (x + y, y). Return a Boolean True if it is possible, else return False.
Example: source point: (2, 10)

List: [2,3,-5,1], the polynomial is 2x^0 + 3x^1 - 5x^2 + 1x^3.
Given value is 1: 2 + (3 * 1) + (-5 * 1^2) + (1 * 1^3) = 1.

//// Moving digit
/*13.
Complete the function Mover that takes three integers: init, digit and target
and calculates the amount of places the digit, that is equal to the digit in
the number init, has to be shifted to the right in order to get the target number.
It is guaranteed that the digit exists in init and has to be shifted to the right.

The digit 3 exists in the init number, and it has to be moved 4 places
in order to get the target number.
